                        <h1 className={'font-extrabold'}>Use License</h1>
                        <p>
                            Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on SyncStack's website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only.
                            This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license, you may not:
                            modify or copy the materials;
                            use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);
                            attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on SyncStack's website;
                            remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials;
                            transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.
                            This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by SyncStack at any time.
                        </p>
